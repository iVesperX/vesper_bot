# Vesper Bot

`v!`

Vesper is built specifically for [Plazma League Discord](https://discord.gg/XM4Djbd). It's main purpose is to store players and teams in a database for later use. I plan to implement the following commands in the near future:

```
v!sign {player}
v!waive {player}

// Draft Implementation
v!draft {draftee}
```

> I never really created a serious Discord bot until Vesper. All code is open-sourced and feel free to use my code wherever you please. ‚ù§
