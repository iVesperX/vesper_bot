# Vesper Bot

`v!`

Vesper is built specifically for [Plazma League Discord](https://discord.gg/XM4Djbd). Plazma League is a competetive event built around [Plazma Burst 2](https://plazmaburst2.com), a side-scrolling flash game developed by Eric Gurt.

Vesper's main purpose is to store players, teams, and verified users in a database for Plazma League use.

> **New!** Instead of SQLite, Vesper is now using JsonDB!

### Implemented Commands (JsonDB)
- `v!register`
- `v!teams`
- `v!players`
- `v!addteam`
- `v!removeteam`
- `v!sign`
- `v!waive`

__I'll go more in depth into each command at a later date.__

> I never really created a serious Discord bot until Vesper. All code is open-sourced and feel free to use my code wherever you please. ❤
