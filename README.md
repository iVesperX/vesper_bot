# Vesper Bot

`v!`

Vesper is built specifically for [Plazma League Discord](https://discord.gg/XM4Djbd). Plazma League is a competetive event built around [Plazma Burst 2](https://plazmaburst2.com), a side-scrolling flash game developed by Eric Gurt.

Vesper's main purpose is to store players, teams, and verified users in a database for Plazma League use.

> **New!** Instead of SQLite, Vesper is now using ~~JsonDB~~ **MongoDB**!

### Implemented Commands (MongoDB)
- `v!register`
- `v!teams`
- `v!players`
- `v!addteam`
- `v!removeteam`
- `v!sign`
- `v!waive`

- **`v!backup`**

__I'll go more in depth into each command at a later date.__

### MongoDB Hosting

Currently, I am hosting my database through [mLab](https://mlab.com/). It's very simple and I enjoy using it to store my data remotely.
